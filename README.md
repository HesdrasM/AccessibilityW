# Web Accessibility Script

This project provides a set of features to improve accessibility on web pages. The script allows users to adjust various visual aspects of the page to ensure a more inclusive experience for people with visual impairments and other specific needs.

## Features

- **Text Size Adjustment**: Allows users to increase or decrease the text size on the page to improve readability.
- **Grayscale**: Toggles the grayscale filter on or off, providing a more visually friendly view for people with visual difficulties.
- **High Contrast**: Switches between high contrast themes (black background with white text or black background with yellow text) to enhance text visibility.
- **Negative Contrast**: Activates negative contrast, changing the background and text colors to make elements more visible.
- **Backlight**: Enables backlight with black text on a white background.
- **Underlined Links**: Toggles between showing or removing the underline from all links on the page.
- **Readable Font**: Changes the page font to a more readable one (Verdana) and adjusts the font size to enhance readability.
- **Reset Accessibility**: Resets all accessibility settings to the default page values.

## How to Use

1. **Integration with HTML**: 
   Add elements with specific `id`s to your HTML to activate accessibility functions (e.g., `comp-ly4rzz911`, `comp-ly4rzz97`, etc.).
   
2. **User Interaction**: 
   The script allows users to interact with the page through clicks to adjust the visual style. Each feature can be toggled on or off by clicking the corresponding buttons.
